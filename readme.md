## Purpose

As per the assignement guidelines, this website aims to present myself as a web and IT professional to possible recruiters within the IT field. The website itself aims to provide informaiton about myself, my work experiences and my goals/skills. 

## Design Process  

The finished product is a website that caters to responsive design, which was built upon a mobile-first perspective. There are 4 main media breakpoints which are outlined in my SCSS files. I believe that the HTML elements themselves are within the Semantic HTML guidelines, however `<div>` is used throughout the code to utlize more formatting using my media breakpoints. 

I had a bit of issues with the original design - once completed it really came across as this psuedo 90's look which wasn't what I was aiming for. This irked me to create a more modern design, utlizing opaic backgrounds using `::before` to bring the pages to life rather than just being plain. 

All professional links are contained within the footer, which is on each of my pages. 

The site itself includes 5 main pages, with an additional page for my resume PDF - Sitemap included below.
