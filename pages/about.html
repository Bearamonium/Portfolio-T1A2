                        Hello! 👋 I'm an INFP-T IT professional, seamlessly blending the logical world of technology with the vibrant hues of creativity and empathy. Picture me as your tech-savvy dreamer, navigating the digital landscape with a heart that beats for innovation and human connection.
                        </p>
                        <p>I'm all about authenticity and deep conversations that make you think. I love getting to know people and celebrating what makes each person special. In a world buzzing with activity, I'm the one soaking in the quiet moments, finding beauty in simple, everyday things. Life, to me, is an adventure of self-discovery and meaningful relationships.</p>
                        <p>While my days are spent crafting lines of code and troubleshooting, my evenings are dedicated to exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. Whether it's designing intuitive user interfaces or finding innovative solutions to everyday challenges, I thrive in the space where logic meets imagination. I'm that team member who not only understands the intricacies of IT but also values the power of collaboration and open communication. In the fast-paced world of technology, I believe in the importance of creating meaningful connections, fostering an environment where ideas flow freely, and teamwork fuels innovation.</p>
                        <p>In the midst of life's hustle, I often carve out moments for introspection. Solitude, to me, is like a cozy blanket that allows me to recharge and unravel the complexities of my thoughts. It's my secret weapon for finding balance and rediscovering the magic in the everyday.</p>
                        <p>While I might be known for my dreamy disposition, I'm also surprisingly resilient when it comes to facing challenges. There's a quiet strength within me that emerges when needed, a strength rooted in my beliefs and the unwavering conviction that every hurdle is a stepping stone to growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, let's embark on a journey where bits and bytes coexist harmoniously with creativity and empathy. Together, let's build a digital landscape that not only functions flawlessly but also resonates with the human touch.</p>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>Beyond the IT realm, I'm a dual enthusiast—avid gamer and passionate artist. In the gaming universe, I conquer mythical realms and embark on epic adventures, channeling creativity into strategic gameplay. On a different canvas, drawing is my meditative escape, where ideas materialize and creativity flows freely. These hobbies not only fuel my creative spirit but also enhance my problem-solving skills, offering a delightful balance to my IT pursuits. Whether discussing the latest games or sharing drawing tips, I'm ready to explore the dynamic interplay between technology and creativity. Let's embark on a quest, be it in a virtual realm or on a blank canvas, where every pixel and every stroke tells a story. 🕹️🎨</p>

                    <h3>Work & Study History</h3>
                    <p>I am currently situated in the finance field - started as a trainee accountant while studying my Bachelor's. After working as a trainee accountant, I decided that it wasn't where my true interests lie paired with the fact I couldn't make any genuine connection with the work I was performing. After finishing my degree, I stepped back into a bookkeeping role, a role I am still in.</p>
